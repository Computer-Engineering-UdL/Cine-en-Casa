# Cine en Casa
### Description
Cine en Casa is a django web application created to supply an urgent demand: automate the creation of a cinema weekly billboard.

#### Cine en Casa (v1.0)
Cine en Casa provides a site to store the information of all the movies, series, programs, etc. that the user wishes to watch in a near future, along with the fast creation of an aesthetic weekly billboard, that displays all the chosen films by the user and its date of emission to broadcast in the 'homecinema'.

#### Future Versions
In future versions of the web application, Cine en Casa will...
- Automate the process of adding a new film to the database with the integration of a public API from IMDB or FilmAffinity.
- Allow connection between users and give feedback to the billboard creator, with suggestions, reviews or additional comments. It will also display the billboards to whom the creator chooses and the viewers will be able to confirm or deny their assistance.
